## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```bash
$ sudo give-me-super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 With great power comes great responsibility.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
